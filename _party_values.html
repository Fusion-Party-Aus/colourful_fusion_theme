        <p>Fusion brings compassionate, evidence-informed policy to Australians</p>
        <h2 class="h-underline h-{{ h_color }}">Our Vision</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <i>The Fusion Party strives for a free, fair, and innovative society for current and future generations, with meaningful work to meet the critical social and ecological challenges of our times. Fusion's approach is to empower communities and foster deliberative democracy across our society.</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Our vision for a brighter and fairer future for Australia is based on our shared core
            values, and policy platform drawn from these foundations. We recognise that there are
            times when our values are (or may appear to be) in conflict, and this is when our
            consultation process must be at its most robust.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h-underline h-{{ h_color }}">Our Mission</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <em>Fusion's mission is to collaborate widely throughout society, to deeply explore underlying issues, and to build consensus for long-term solutions.</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Community consultation is of our top priorities, so we strive to embody the transparent
            and accountable democracy we want for our nation.</p>
        <p >Confronting the climate emergency and reversing global warming
            are critical for our continued prosperity and happiness. Public education, healthcare
            and scientific research are important investments in our long-term future. Policy should
            empower citizens, promoting rights and freedomsâ€”including in the digital spaces that are
            now part of our everyday lives.</p>
